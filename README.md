# DiscordRoleBot

A bot that will, once it's completed, be able to assign roles based on reactions to messages. If you wish to create your own implementation, follow instructions that I may add at some point in the future.

Basic instructions so far:
First, install all dependencies in requirements.txt
Then, create a file called env.py in the same directory as bot.py. It should contain:
```python
# env.py
DISCORD_TOKEN = "[your bot token here]"
```
Other than that, it should be fairly simple. Run with `python bot.py`
