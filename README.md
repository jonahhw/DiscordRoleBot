# DiscordTesting

A useless discord bot that I'm using to practice git, python, and discord-specific python

Starting based on the Real Python discord bot tutorial and I might try other things after that

If for some reason you think this would be useful and want to use it, look at the [tutorial](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/). It has instructions on how to do things like make a .env file.
